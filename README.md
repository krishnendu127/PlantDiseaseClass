Plant Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset used in this project is the PlantVillage Dataset available on Kaggle.
This project utilizes convolutional neural networks to classify plant diseases using the PlantVillage Dataset.
By leveraging deep learning techniques, it aims to assist farmers in early detection and management of plant diseases, promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
Through automated image analysis, the project seeks to enhance crop yield and reduce crop losses caused by diseases.

Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Data Curation: The PlantVillage dataset is downloaded and prepared for training.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and validation sets for model training.
Model Definition: A CNN model is defined using TensorFlow/Keras.
Model Training: The defined model is trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the validation set to measure its performance.
Building a Predictive System: A function is created to load, preprocess, and classify new images using the trained model.

Usage
Clone this repository.
